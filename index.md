### Research Software Engineering Group

Research has become more and more reliant on software, whether for
numerical modelling, data analysis or visualisation. Researchers also
often spend a proportion of their time developing their own software,
something which has been recognised nationally, and encouraged by the
[Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk). Increasingly,
the role of the Research Software Engineer (RSE), who devotes a
significant amount of their time to research software development has
also come to the fore, and there is an active [national association](https://society-rse.org).

The "RSE Group" pages on this website are intended to be a forum to
bring together the diverse community of research software engineers in
the University of Cambridge. Our activities include:

* An annual "Computation Seminar Day" which highlights local
  researchers using computational methods (see previous years
  schedules), and is a community networking event.
* [A seminar series](http://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/69831)
* Building a local community of RSEs who can support each other.

More information about the individuals and teams can be found in the
[People](people) section.
