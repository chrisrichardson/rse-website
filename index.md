### Research Software Engineering Group

Research has become more and more reliant on software, whether for
numerical modelling, data analysis or visualisation. Researchers also
often spend a proportion of their time developing their own software,
something which has been recognised nationally, and encouraged by the
[Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk). Increasingly,
the role of the Research Software Engineer (RSE), who devotes a
significant amount of their time to research software development has
also come to the fore, and a [national association](https://society-rse.org) has been formed.

In Cambridge, as at many other universities, we have a Research
Software Group as part of the HPC team in
[UIS](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/research-software-engineering), as
well as several RSEs distributed across departments. Our activities
include:

* An annual "Computation Seminar Day" which highlights local
  researchers using computational methods (see previous years
  schedules).
* [A seminar series](http://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/69831)
* Building a local community of RSEs who can support each other.
