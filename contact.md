### Contact

The RSE group is an informal community within the University of
Cambridge. If you have specific enquiries, it is probably best to
contact an individual. You can also sign up to our mailing list: [ucam-rse@lists.cam.ac.uk](https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/subscribe/ucam-rse).

For general questions and information about the
mailing list or seminar series, email:
[ucam-rse-request@cam.ac.uk](mailto:ucam-rse-request@cam.ac.uk).
