title: Computation Day 2019
---

## March 18th 2019

#### Venue
Dept Chemistry, Lensfield Road

Building on the success of the previous years' events, the goal of
this workshop was to bring together researchers and programmers from
different departments with common interests in the following areas:

* Research in Scientific Computing
* Software engineering and sustainable software development
* Computing infrastructure and High Performance Computing

Staff and graduate students were invited to give lightning talks and posters on their
work and the topics listed above.
